\title{Generate a fake dataset of name counts with “garbled” variants}
\usage{
synthetic_name_counts()
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{name}: character, the (possibly garbled) name
\item \code{count}: integer, the number of times it appears
}
}
\description{
This function builds a synthetic name‐count dataset by starting from the
built-in \code{state.name} vector, replicating each name, applying random
character substitutions (“garbling”), and then counting the frequencies of
both clean and garbled names.
}
\examples{
# Generate a toy dataset
df <- synthetic_name_counts()
head(df)

}
